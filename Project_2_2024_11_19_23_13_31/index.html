           <p>Climate change is very important to me because it is something that affects everyone and it could majorly impact our lives in a negative way. We can already start to see the effects through the rising temperatures, getting less and less snow in the winters, the abundance of natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, and so much more. I made this piece to bring to light the good and the bad statistics of climate change to urge viewers to do something about their situation whether it is making a massive change to their companies or something small like learning more about the situation at hand.

          <p>Theres a saying about a frog and a pot of boiling water. If you put the frog into the pot while it is boiling, it will just jump out. However, if you put the frog in the water and slowly crank the heat up, it will boil alive without jumping out. It seems as though humanity is much like the frog in that we are letting our world get hotter and hotter, but because the change hasn't been drastic, we refuse to see it for what it is. Well here is the pot of boiling water that will hopefully change things.</p>
